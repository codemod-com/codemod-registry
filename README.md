This repo contains an organized and maintained collection of codemods that can be used to help you upgrade several frameworks and libraries for your projects.

The codemods included in this repository are built on top of existing codemod engines such as jscodeshift and ts-morph. Intuita is working on supporting more codemod engines. If you would like to see a specific engine supported, please [leave us a feature request â†’](https://feedback.intuita.io/feature-requests-and-bugs).

## Why

Using Intuitaâ€™s Codemod Registry helps provide a better experience with upgrading codebases using codemods. Using existing codemods or integrating your codemods into the registry allows for:

-   Being automatically integrated into the [Intuita VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Intuita.intuita-vscode-extension).
-   Allowing your codemods to be reviewed and improved by [a community of codemod experts](https://join.slack.com/t/intuita-inc/shared_invite/zt-1tvxm6ct0-mLZld_78yguDYOSM7DM7Cw).
-   Empowering and helping many developers around the world.
