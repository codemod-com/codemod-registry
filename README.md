# Codemod Registry

Codemod Registry is an open-source, single-stop repository for codemods and code automation recipes. Codemod Registry brings an ever-growing variety of helpful codemods all in one place.

Codemods available in Codemod Registry are automatically integrated into [Intuita's platform](https://docs.intuita.io/docs/intro) and all developers who have Intuita's [CLI](https://docs.intuita.io/docs/cli/quickstart) or [IDE extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Intuita.intuita-vscode-extension) can then discover, share, and run those codemods with a single click.

Currently, Intuita's platform supports `jscodeshift`, `ts-morph`, and Uber's Piranha codemod engines. If you would like to see a specific codemod engine supported, please [leave us a feature request](https://feedback.intuita.io/feature-requests-and-bugs).

If there is a codemod you would like to see available in Codemod Registry, please consider opening a PR to add the codemod. Learn [more about contributing here](#contributing).
